# Pepper and Carrot RPG
## Introduction

Pepper & Carrot is based on the characters and world of Hereva created by David Revoy and the Pepper & Carrot community. The characters and story appear in the Pepper & Carrot webcomic (available at http://peppercarrot.com)

## The system

The Pepper & Carrot RPG uses the Fate Accelerated role playing system.


## Things the players will be able to do

Players in the Pepper and Carrot RPG will be able to play as any one of the characters from the comic. This includes:

* Pepper, the main protagonist, who always seems to be getting into trouble as she tries to prove to her godmothers that she is a true witch of Chaosah despite their machinations.

* Saffron, the spoiled rich girl who owns a thriving witchcraft business but still longs for something more that money can't buy.

* Coriander, the tinkerer, who wants to transform her magic school into one of the more powerful schools for making things.

* Schichimi, the reluctant ascetic, who longs for a less strict and more comfortable existence despite the wishes of the leaders of Ah.

* Cayenne, the Chaosah enforcer, who wants to return Chaosah to it's rightful place as a magic to be feared.

* Thyme, the Chaosah matriarch, who wants to prolong Pepper's training so her sentence of being trapped as a personal lackey of Wasabi will be postponed.

* Cumin, the Chaosah potions instructor, who is the apprentice of Thyme and wants to ensure that Thyme is happy with her performance.

* Wasabi, the leader of Ah, who wants to export the perfect order and asceticism of Ah to all of the other magic schools.

Players can also create characters based on each of the magic schools:

* Ah, who wish to please the spirits by living a life free of material wants and desires.
* Chaosah, who wish to learn, understand, and control the fundamental forces of Hereva and bend them to their will.
* Zombiah, who wish to make death an unnecessary part of living, and to automate mundane tasks.
* Magmah, who wish to make better, stronger, and flashier materials, for a price.
* Aquah, who wish to be left alone and are grudgingly brought to the surface when required.
* Hippiah, who wish to help people to grow food and other materials better and more naturally.

Example scenarios:

* Iron Chef Potion Contest: Players are set to compete in a potion contest, but as an added twist the contestants must locate a special ingredient that is uncommon and hard to find / dangerous to pick up. They could work separately to locate this ingredient but their chances are much better if they work together (cooperatively or not).
