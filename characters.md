## Pepper

Pepper is a 14 year old orphan girl. She lives in the forests outside of the small farming village of Squirrel's End. She lives with her constant companion and familiar Carrot (so named for both his orange fur and for being found in a bushel of carrots). Her constant companions are the remaining members of the magic school of Chaosah, whom she refers to as her godmothers. They tutor in the ways of Chaosah magic (the most primal form of magic in Hereva) guiding her on her path to becoming a "True Witch of Chaosah". This unfortunately has double-meaning for Pepper as she is not totally sure what a true witch of Chaosah is, and what she will become. She also doesn't trust her godmothers to be forthright with her on what a witch of Chaosah stands for.
