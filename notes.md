# Notes about the Pepper&Carrot Fate-based RPG

## Goals

* Make a fun family game based on the world of Hereva
* Combine the open world of Pepper&Carrot with the Fate system

## Design notes
* Designing this with Fate Accelerated in mind.
* Need to come up with scenarios of games that I envision folks playing with this game.
  * Need more than simple errands. Plenty of opportunities for "delivery" types of missions, but not much else.
