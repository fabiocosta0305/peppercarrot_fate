# Notes about the Pepper&Carrot Fate-based RPG

## Goals

* Make a fun family game based on the world of Hereva
* Combine the open world of Pepper&Carrot with the Fate system

## Design notes
* Not yet sure if I want to go with Fate Accelerated or Fate Core (or a combination of the two)
* Need to come up with scenarios of games that I envision folks playing with this game.
