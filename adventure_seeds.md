## Chaosah Buries their Failures
* The Witches of Chaosah have a long tradition of burying their failures. But not all failures are complete failures, and some of them are not as "inert" as one would like:
* Potions are leaking out and combining in unpredictable ways. It's up to the characters to find the source of the problem and render the potions inert before the potions combine in even more terrible ways.
* Too much Rea in one area attracts folks looking to harvest the Rea for their own purposes. The wrong folks getting their hands on that much Rea could have dire consequences.
* After some flooding the layer of ground that covered one of the failures eroded away and one of the failures has surfaced.
  * Chaosah won't admit to mixing their magic with one of the other magical disciplines, and maybe they were caught mixing Chaosah magic with another school's magic: Magmah, or Zombiah for instance?
  * Perhaps an experiment to find ways to take Chaosah magic closer to the magical fundamentals was abandoned too soon; just before an important breakthrough. The witches of Chaosah have heard of this legendary experiment, and the notes that surfaced contain clues for how to continue the experiments.
* In a fit of cleaning Cumin buried some magical artifacts that should not have been buried. Unfortunately she doesn't remember where she buried them. Normally this wouldn't be a problem, except Thyme is waiting on them and doesn't realize they're missing. Help!

## Potion Challenges
* Not only have the witches been summoned for a potion challenge, they also need to find the ingredients to make the potions!
  * The secret ingredient for the potion challenge is located in a hidden location. The witches must work together to locate where the ingredient is, and (more importantly) what the ingredient is. 
  * Did we mention there's a time limit? Of course there's a time limit.
  * To find the ingredient the witches need to use their available resources. Naturally not all of these resources will be cooperative.
  * Ideally this will spawn cooperation between the witches but certain groups may wish to season this with a little more competition. The group should be working toward finding the ingredient but each of the witches may have different ideas of how the ingredient gets used.

## Squirrel's End Adventure Seeds
* Pepper has forgotten to disarm her traps again. The witches will need to head out to disarm Pepper's clever traps. Hope they don't miss one!
  * This scenario is best with some GM creativity. Some sample traps are provided to give you some ideas on the flavor of traps but we encourage you to make your own.
