# Possible adventure seeds

* The Witches of Chaosah have a long tradition of burying their failures. But not all failures are complete failures, and some of them are not as "inert" as one would like:
  * Potions are leaking out and combining in unpredictable ways. It's up to the characters to find the source of the problem and render the potions inert before the potions combine in even more terrible ways.
  * Too much Rea in one area attracts folks looking to harvest the Rea for their own purposes. The wrong folks getting their hands on that much Rea could have dire consequences.
  * After some flooding the layer of ground that covered one of the failures eroded away and one of the failures has surfaced.
    * Chaosah won't admit to mixing their magic with one of the other magical disciplines, and maybe they were caught mixing Chaosah magic with another school's magic: Magmah, or Zombiah for instance?
    * Perhaps an experiment to find ways to take Chaosah magic closer to the magical fundamentals was abandoned too soon; just before an important breakthrough. The witches of Chaosah have heard of this experiment, and the notes that surfaced contain clues for how to continue the experiments.
  * In a fit if cleaning Cumin buried some magical artifacts that should not have been buried. Unfortunately she doesn't remember where she buried them. Normally this wouldn't be a problem, except Thyme is waiting on them and doesn't realize they're missing. Help!
