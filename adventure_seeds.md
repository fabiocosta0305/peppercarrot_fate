# Possible adventure seeds

* The Witches of Chaosah have a long tradition of burying their failures. But not all failures are complete failures, and some of them are not as "inert" as one would like:
  * Potions are leaking out and wreaking havoc across the landscape.
  * Too much Rea in one area attracts  folks looking to harvest the Rea for their own purposes. The wrong folks getting their hands on that much Rea could have dire consequences.
  * After some flooding the layer of ground that covered one of the failures eroded away and one of the failures has surfaced.
    * Chaosah won't admit to mixing their magic with one of the other magical disciplines, and maybe they were caught mixing Chaosah magic with another school's magic: Magmah, or Zombiah for instance?
    * Perhaps an experiment found another magic that was closer to the fundamentals than Chaosah, and the discovery was abandoned too soon.
